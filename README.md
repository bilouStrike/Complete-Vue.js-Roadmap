## Milestone 01: Core Vue.js Fundamentals  
> Build a strong foundation in Vue.js by learning the core concepts of reactive programming, components, and the Vue instance.

### Unit 01: Introduction to Vue.js  
> Understand what Vue.js is, why it's popular, and how to set it up.  
- What is Vue.js and how it compares to React/Angular  
- Installing Vue CLI and creating a project  
- Vue DevTools and project structure  
- The Vue instance and template syntax  
- Practical exercise: Create a basic Vue "To-Do List" using Vue CLI.

### Unit 02: Data Binding and Reactivity  
> Dive into Vue’s reactivity system and how data flows in the UI.  
- `data`, `methods`, and `computed` properties  
- `v-model`, `v-bind`, and `v-on` directives  
- Event handling and input binding  
- Watchers vs Computed  
- Practical exercise: Build a live character counter that updates with user input.

### Unit 03: Components & Props  
> Learn how to break your app into reusable, modular components.  
- Creating and registering components  
- Passing data with props  
- Emitting custom events  
- Component communication patterns  
- Practical exercise: Build a parent-child component that communicates with props and emits.

### Unit 04: Conditional Rendering and Lists  
> Explore Vue directives for dynamic content and lists.  
- `v-if`, `v-else-if`, `v-show`  
- `v-for` and key bindings  
- Handling empty states  
- Looping through nested arrays or objects  
- Practical exercise: Create a product list with conditional stock messages.

## Milestone 02: Intermediate Vue.js Features  
> Expand your knowledge with lifecycle hooks, forms, routing, and state management basics.

### Unit 01: Lifecycle Hooks  
> Learn how Vue handles component initialization and destruction.  
- `created`, `mounted`, `updated`, `destroyed`  
- Use cases for each hook  
- Lifecycle debugging techniques  
- Practical exercise: Log each lifecycle phase for a dynamic component.

### Unit 02: Vue Router  
> Add navigation to your Vue apps using Vue Router.  
- Installing and setting up Vue Router  
- Creating routes and route components  
- Dynamic routes and route params  
- Navigation guards and lazy loading  
- Practical exercise: Build a multi-page Vue app with dynamic routing.

### Unit 03: Forms & Input Validation  
> Handle complex forms and validate user input.  
- Two-way data binding with forms  
- Validation with Vuelidate or custom rules  
- Handling form submission  
- Dynamic form fields  
- Practical exercise: Create a user registration form with real-time validation.

### Unit 04: Introduction to Vuex (State Management)  
> Manage global state with Vuex for large-scale applications.  
- Vuex store, state, getters, mutations, and actions  
- Module-based state management  
- Vuex vs props/events  
- Practical exercise: Build a shopping cart using Vuex to manage cart state.


## Milestone 03: Advanced Vue Ecosystem & Best Practices  
> Learn to build scalable Vue applications with testing, composition API, and performance optimization.

### Unit 01: Composition API  
> Embrace Vue 3’s Composition API for flexible logic organization.  
- `setup()` function  
- `ref`, `reactive`, `computed`, `watch`  
- Creating and using composables  
- When to use Composition API vs Options API  
- Practical exercise: Refactor a Vue 2-style app using Composition API.

### Unit 02: Vue 3 Advanced Features  
> Use Vue 3 capabilities to build powerful components and features.  
- Teleport  
- Suspense and async components  
- Provide/inject  
- Custom directives  
- Practical exercise: Build a modal component using teleport and async content.

### Unit 03: Testing Vue Applications  
> Write unit and integration tests for Vue components.  
- Using Vue Test Utils and Jest  
- Testing props, events, and state changes  
- Snapshot testing  
- Mocking API calls  
- Practical exercise: Write unit tests for a Vue form component.

### Unit 04: Performance Optimization & Deployment  
> Prepare your Vue app for production.  
- Lazy loading and code splitting  
- Caching and prefetching  
- Vue.config optimizations  
- Deploying to Netlify, Vercel, or Firebase  
- Practical exercise: Optimize and deploy a small Vue app to Netlify.
